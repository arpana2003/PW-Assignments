The position property in CSS is used to specify how an element is positioned within its parent container or the viewport. It determines the positioning mechanism for the element and the coordinates used to place it.

Types of Positioning in CSS
There are five types of positioning in CSS:

1. static (Default Positioning)
Definition: This is the default positioning for all elements. The element is positioned based on the normal document flow (from top to bottom).

2. relative (Relative Positioning)
Definition: The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. You can use top, right, bottom, and left to move it relative to its normal position.

3. absolute (Absolute Positioning)
Definition: The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., an ancestor element with a position of relative, absolute, or fixed). If no such ancestor exists, it will be positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the <html> or <body> element).

4. fixed (Fixed Positioning)
Definition: The element is positioned relative to the viewport (browser window) and remains in the same place even when the page is scrolled.

5. sticky (Sticky Positioning)
Definition: The element is positioned based on the userâ€™s scroll position. It acts like relative positioning until it reaches a defined point (like top: 0), at which point it behaves like fixed positioning and stays "stuck" in place.

The z-index property in CSS controls the stacking order of elements that overlap. It specifies the depth of an element relative to others in the same stacking context.

Definition: The z-index determines which element appears in front of others when multiple elements are positioned on top of each other. The higher the z-index value, the closer the element will be to the top layer of the stacking context.
Usage: It is used when you have overlapping elements and you want to control which element should appear above or below others.
