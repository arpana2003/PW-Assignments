The "Hello, World!" program is a traditional starting point for learning programming languages because:

Simplicity: It’s a minimal example that introduces basic syntax and structure without overwhelming complexity.
Verification: It ensures the environment is set up correctly (e.g., the compiler or interpreter works).
Universality: It’s a widely recognized starting exercise, creating a sense of familiarity across languages.

Use of Comments
Comments are used to add explanatory notes to the code, making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand.
They help in debugging by allowing you to temporarily disable code.
Comments are ignored by the browser and do not affect the webpage.

<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph that will display.</p>
<!-- <p>This paragraph is commented out and won't display.</p> -->

An element consists of a start tag, content (optional), and an end tag. It represents the structure and content on a webpage.

<p>This is an element.</p>


Tags are the building blocks of HTML and are enclosed in angle brackets. They define the type of content.

Start tag: <p>
End tag: </p>

Attributes provide additional information about an element. They are defined within the start tag and have a name-value pair.

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters (e.g., <, >, &) or characters that are not easily typed on a keyboard.
