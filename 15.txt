HTML5 introduced several new features to improve web development, including:

1. New Semantic Tags
Tags like <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, and <aside> improve content structure and readability.
2. Multimedia Support
Audio and Video Tags:
<audio> and <video> allow embedding media without external plugins like Flash.

Semantic tags are HTML5 elements that convey meaning about the content they enclose. They make the structure of the webpage more understandable to both browsers and developers.

Examples of Semantic Tags
<header>: Defines the header section of a webpage or section.
<footer>: Represents the footer section.
<article>: Represents independent, self-contained content.
<section>: Defines a thematic grouping of content.
<nav>: Indicates navigation links.

Uses of Semantic Tags

Semantic tags make the code easier to read and maintain.

2:Enhanced Accessibility

Assistive technologies (like screen readers) can better interpret and navigate the content.
3:SEO Benefits

Search engines prioritize semantic tags for better indexing and ranking.
4:Consistent Styling

Enables developers to style content sections specifically using CSS.
