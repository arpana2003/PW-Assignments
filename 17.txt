CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements on a web page. It separates content (HTML) from design, making websites more visually appealing and easier to maintain.

Why Use CSS?
Styling: Adds visual effects like colors, fonts, borders, and animations.
Layout Control: Positions and aligns elements using techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
Consistency: Ensures a uniform look and feel across multiple pages of a website.

Ways to Bring CSS into an HTML File
1:Inline CSS

Directly applied to a specific element using the style attribute.
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is a paragraph.</p>

2:Internal CSS

Defined within a <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML file.
<style>
  p {
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
  }
</style>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

3:External CSS

Linked as a separate .css file, which is the best practice for maintaining larger projects.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

Specificity is a set of rules in CSS that determine which styles are applied to an element when there are conflicting declarations. The higher the specificity, the more precedence the rule has.

How Specificity Works
Each type of selector has a specificity value:
Inline Styles: Highest specificity (e.g., style="color: red;").
ID Selectors (#id): High specificity.
Class Selectors (.class), Attribute Selectors ([type="text"]), and Pseudo-classes (:hover): Medium specificity.
Element Selectors (div, p): Low specificity.
