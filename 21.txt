Media queries in CSS are a way to apply different styles depending on the device characteristics (e.g., screen size, resolution, orientation) or viewport size. They allow developers to create responsive designs that adjust to various screen sizes, ensuring the website or web application is usable and visually appealing on any device.

Use Case of Media Queries
Media queries are primarily used in responsive web design. They enable CSS rules to be applied dynamically based on conditions such as:

Screen width (e.g., for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices)
Screen resolution (e.g., Retina displays)
Orientation (landscape or portrait)
Device type (e.g., print media)

-----------------------------------------

Both min-width and max-width are used in media queries to set specific styles based on the width of the viewport (browser window), but they work in opposite ways.

1. min-width
Definition: The style rules defined within a media query with min-width are applied only when the viewport is at least as wide as the specified value.
Use Case: Typically used to apply styles to larger devices or screens, such as tablets, desktops, and larger monitors

EXAMPLE:
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    width: 80%;
  }
}

2. max-width
Definition: The style rules defined within a media query with max-width are applied only when the viewport is smaller than or equal to the specified value.
Use Case: Typically used to apply styles for mobile-first or smaller devices.

EXAMPLE:
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    width: 100%;
  }
}

Float Property and Clear Property in CSS
1. float Property
The float property is used to position an element to the left or right of its container, allowing other content to wrap around it. It's typically used for creating layouts like text wrapping around images, or for simple column layouts.

element {
  float: left; /* or float: right; */
}

2. clear Property
The clear property is used to control the behavior of elements after a floated element. It ensures that the element is positioned below the floated element, not next to it.

Syntax:

element {
  clear: left;   /* Prevents element from floating on the left */
  clear: right;  /* Prevents element from floating on the right */
  clear: both;   /* Prevents element from floating on either side */
}
